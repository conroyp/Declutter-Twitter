This extension is for use on the Twitter.com web interface. 
It allows entry of a list of keywords which will trigger hiding of a tweet. This can
be useful for when otherwise follow-worthy folk start tweeting about one particular
topic in which you've no interest (ipad, politics, football, etc).

It is based on the bookmarklet originally described at http://www.conroyp.com/2010/03/11/declutter/ 
The original bookmarklet works on the old twitter interface, this version should support both
old and new twitter web interfaces, and remove the user-unfriendliness associated with
having to repeatedly re-assert bookmarklets.
